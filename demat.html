<h1>What Is Demat Account</h1>
<img src="Demat-Accountimg.jpg" alt="">
<strong>What is Demat account?</strong>
<p>A Demat Account or Dematerialised Account provides the facility of holding shares and securities in an electronic format. During online trading, shares are bought and held in a Demat Account, thus, facilitating easy trade for the users. A Demat Account holds all the investments an individual makes in shares, government securities, exchange-traded funds, bonds and mutual funds in one place.</p>
<p>Demat enabled the digitisation process of the Indian stock trading market and enforced better governance by SEBI. In addition, the Demat account reduced the risks of storing, theft, damage, and malpractices by storing securities in electronic format. It was first introduced in 1996 by NSE. Initially, the account opening process was manual, and it took investors several days to get it activated. Today, one can open a Demat account online in 5 mins. The end-to-end digital process has contributed to popularising Demat, which skyrocketed in the pandemic.</p><hr>
<strong>Importance of Demat account</strong>
<p>A Demat account provides a digitally secure and convenient way of holding shares and securities. It eliminates theft, forgery, loss and damage of physical certificates. With a Demat account, you can transfer securities immediately. Once the trade is approved, the shares are digitally transferred to your account. Moreover, in case events like stock bonuses, mergers, etc., you get shares automatically into your account. Your Demat account information regarding these activities is available online by simply logging into the website. You can trade on-the-go using your smartphone or desktop. So, you needn’t visit the stock exchange to transact. You also enjoy the benefit of reduced transaction costs because there is no stamp duty involved with the transfer of shares. These features and benefits of a Demat account encourage a larger trade volume by investors, thus increasing the potential for lucrative returns.</p>
<p>Demat account has made it easier to handle stocks. The Indian exchanges now follow the settlement cycle of T+2 days facilitated by the Demat account. You pay the seller on the second business day when you buy shares following the settlement cycle, and your Demat account gets automatically credited with the purchased securities. Demat account has made the process of security trading seamless and hassle-free.</p><hr>

<strong>How does a Demat Account work?</strong>
<p>Trading through a Demat account is similar to the procedure of physical trading, except that a Demat account is electronic. You begin trading by placing an order through your online trading account. For this purpose, it is necessary to link both trading and Demat accounts. Once an order is placed, the exchange will process the order. Demat account details the market price of shares and the availability of shares is verified before the final processing of the order. On completion of the processing, shares are then reflected in your statement of holdings. When a shareholder wishes to sell shares, a delivery instruction note has to be provided with details of the stock. Shares are then debited from the account and the equivalent cash value is credited to the trading account.</p>

<p>The Demat account opening process involves three parties - your bank, the depository participant, and the depository. Tagging your bank account with your Demat account is critical for trading seamlessly. Linking your account details ensure when you buy shares, the money gets debited directly from your bank account, and when you sell, the proceeds get automatically credited.</p>
<p>A depository participant can be a non-banking financial institution, a bank, or a stockbroker. You would need to approach a DP to open a Demat account. The third party is obviously the depository. They hold the Demat account on your behalf.</p><hr>
<strong>Types of Demat account</strong>
<p>While opening a Demat account, investors need to select a Demat account type that suits their profile carefully. The most common type is a regular Demat account. Any Indian investor or resident Indian can open a standard Demat account within a few minutes using an online account opening process. Apart from the standard Demat account, there are two other types. Let's take a look at them.</p>
<p>There are two types of Demat accounts—Repatriable Demat account and Non-repatriable Demat account. Repatriable funds are deposited in a separate bank account known as the Non-Resident External Account (NRE account). Repatriable funds are those funds which can be transferred abroad. The investments made from these funds are maintained in a The Repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from repatriable funds. On the other hand, non-repatriable funds (funds which cannot be taken/transferred abroad) are deposited in a different bank account known as the Non Resident Ordinary Account (NRO account).The Non-repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from non-repatriable funds. Money can easily be transferred from an NRE to an NRO account. However, once the transfer is made, the repatriability is lost and the money cannot be transferred back to the NRE account.</p><hr>
<strong>Types of Demat account</strong>
<dl>
    <dt>Regular Demat account:</dt>
        <dd>Regular Demat account is for resident Indian investors who want to trade in shares alone and need a storing for securities. The stocks get debited from your Demat account when you sell and credited when you purchase during trading. If you are trading in F&O, you don't need a Demat account because these contracts don't need storage.</dd>
        <dt>Basic Services Demat Account:</dt>
        <dd> It is a new type of Demat account introduced by the SEBI. These accounts don't have maintenance changes if the holding value is less than Rs 50,000. Between Rs 50,000 and 2 lakh, the changes are Rs 100. The new type of account targets new investors who are yet to open a Demat account.</dd>
        <dt>Repatriable Demat Account:</dt>
        <dd> Non-resident Indian investors open a repatriable account to transfer their earnings from the Indian market abroad. If you want to open a repatriable account, you'll have to close your regular Demat account in India and open a non-resident external account to receive payments.</dd>
        <dt>Non-repatriable account:</dt>
        <dd>This account is also for non-resident Indians, but it doesn't allow fund transfer to foreign locations.</dd>
